# Undergraduate-Research
Contains my personal contributions to undergraduate research done under the supervision of University of Washington Professor Željko Ivezić in 2023 as well as links to the final paper and public data repository that were produced from the research. 

The bulk of the work I performed involved applying analysis and visualization to data queried from the European Space Agency's GAIA catalog. A selection of 3 million stars and 300,00 quasars from the Milky Way were chosen to have various aspects of their properties measured and confirmed. This data is intended for future use in increasing the speed and efficiency of data processing for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory which will conduct a ten year survey of the Southern Hemisphere's sky and is expected to produce about 60 petabytes of data by the end of the project.

Links to the final paper and the public repository containing the entire team's data will be provided here, later, once our paper has finished going through the review process and has been fully published.
